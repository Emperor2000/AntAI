This project was built using Angular as an assignment in the third year at Avans University of Applied Sciences. It is created by users Emperor2000 and StijnvLoon. The goal was to create an AI regulated ant colony. The AI maximizes the colonies' lifetime by altering the distribution of different ant types. 
The ants, represented by circles navigate the grid using the A* search algorithm.
